# Bash Script Structure - Part 1 - Core Components

# The scripts we write in Bash have three core parts a beginning, a middle and an end.
# Always begins with a #!/bin/bash

#!/bin/bash

# If you run the file command, you can see the type of file as seen below:

file our_first_script
our_first_script: Bourne-Again shell script, ASCII text executable

# If it were a python file, the script would start with the following ---> #!/usr/bin/python3

file our_first_script
our_first_script: Python script, ASCII text executable

# The final core component of a bash script is the exit statement.
# By entering different exit codes, the exit statement also tells the Shell whether the script
# has completed successfully or unsuccessfully.
# Exit statuses can have any value from 0 to 255.
# 0 = pass | 1 = fail

# However, some exit codes have special meanings, and knowing these can help your scripts to play nice with other programs.
# Checkout the ssite below for all you need to know about exit codes.

# To give 'our_script.sh' execute permissions:

# When running a script from the current directory, use ./<sript> to execute:

./our_first_script.sh 
This is my first script
